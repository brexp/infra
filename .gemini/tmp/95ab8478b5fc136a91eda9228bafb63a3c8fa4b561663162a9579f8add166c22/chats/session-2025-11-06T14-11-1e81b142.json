This service helps eliminate \"it works on my machine\" issues, accelerates developer onboarding, and integrates with tools like Gemini Code Assist.[1][2][3][4]\n\nHere's a guide to setting up Google Cloud Workstations:\n\n### 1. Prerequisites\n\nBefore you begin, ensure you have the following:\n\n*   **Google Cloud Account:** A Google Cloud account with an active billing account.[5][6][7]\n*   **Google Cloud Project:** A Google Cloud project where you will deploy your workstations.[5][6][7]\n*   **Enable Cloud Workstations API:** The Cloud Workstations API must be enabled in your project.[5][6][7][8][9]\n*   **IAM Permissions:** You need appropriate Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles, such as `workstations.clusters.create`, `workstations.workstationConfigs.create`, `workstations.workstationClusters.create`, and the `Cloud Workstations Admin` role to create configurations.[1][6]\n*   **VPC Network (Optional but Recommended):** While not strictly mandatory for a basic setup, it's recommended to have a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network and subnetwork for enhanced security and connectivity to internal resources.[10][8]\n\n### 2. Setup Steps (using Google Cloud Console)\n\nThe setup involves creating a workstation cluster, a workstation configuration, and then the workstation itself.\n\n#### Step 2.1: Create a Workstation Cluster\n\nA workstation cluster is a logical grouping of workstations within a specific Google Cloud region and VPC network. It includes a controller and a gateway to manage and route traffic.[1][11]\n\n1.  Navigate to the **Cloud Workstations > Cluster management** page in the Google Cloud console.[10][7]\n2.  Click **Create**.[10][7]\n3.  Provide a **Name** for your workstation cluster (e.g., `dev-cluster`).[10][7]\n4.  Select the **Region** closest to you.[10][7]\n5.  (Optional) Expand **Network settings** to select a custom VPC network and subnetwork if you have one. You can also choose between a Public or Private gateway.[10][8]\n6.  Click **Create**. Cluster creation can take up to 20 minutes.[6][12][8]\n\n#### Step 2.2: Create a Workstation Configuration\n\nA workstation configuration acts as a blueprint or template for creating consistent workstations. It defines specifications like the VM instance type, persistent storage, the container image (which includes the IDE and development tools), and user access.[1][3][6]\n\n1.  Navigate to **Cloud Workstations > Workstation configurations** in the Google Cloud console.[6][7]\n2.  Click **Create**.[6][7]\n3.  Enter a **Name** for your configuration (e.g., `dev-config`).[6][7]\n4.  Choose the workstation **Cluster** you created in the previous step.[6][7]\n5.  Configure **Machine settings**, such as CPU, RAM, and disk size. You can also enable \"Quick start workstations\" for faster startup times, though this may incur additional costs.[6][12][9]\n6.  **Customize the environment** by selecting a base editor (e.g., Code OSS, JetBrains IDEs) or specifying a custom container image.[2][13][6][12]\n7.  **Add users** by defining IAM policies to grant access to specific developers or groups.[6][12][8]\n8.  Click **Create**.[6][7]\n\n#### Step 2.3: Create a Workstation\n\nA workstation is the actual virtual machine instance where developers write, test, and deploy code.[1][3]\n\n1.  Navigate to the **Cloud Workstations > Workstations** page in the Google Cloud console.[5][7]\n2.  Click **Create**.[5][7]\n3.  Provide a **Name** for your workstation.[5][7]\n4.  Select the **Workstation configuration** you created earlier.[5][7]\n5.  Click **Create**.[5]\n\n#### Step 2.4: Launch and Connect to Your Workstation\n\nOnce your workstation is created, you can start and launch it.\n\n1.  On the **Cloud Workstations > Workstations** page, find your newly created workstation.[5]\n2.  Select the checkbox next to it and click **Start**. This will provision the VM and attach the persistent disk.[5]\n3.  Once the status changes to \"Running,\" click **Launch**.[5]\n4.  This will typically open the browser-based IDE (e.g., Code OSS) in a new tab.[5][12][8]\n5.  Alternatively, you can connect using:\n    *   **Local IDEs:** Such as JetBrains IDEs via JetBrains Gateway or VS Code.[2][3][4]\n    *   **SSH:** Using the `gcloud workstations ssh` command from your local terminal.[5][14]\n\n### 3. Key Concepts and Customization\n\n*   **Custom Container Images:** For tailored development environments, you can build your own Docker images with specific tools and libraries, then store them in Google Artifact Registry and reference them in your workstation configuration.[13][11][15]\n*   **Cost Management:** Implement inactivity timeouts to automatically shut down idle workstations and reduce costs. You can also disable \"Quick start workstations\" if cost optimization is a higher priority than instant startup.[2][9]\n*   **Security:** Cloud Workstations enhance security by running environments within your VPC, allowing for private ingress/egress, and integrating with IAM for granular access control. You can also enforce \"no source code on local devices\" policies.[2][15]\n\nSources:\n[1] medium.com (https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEqQKK71SBFHxtmKyEJxqFo1GGkjJwRjinjZRKQ0ExIyNeXps7vbC3MsRM4a6S0vY7jr8xmIgpoKGokF5LtP4yrdamV6gEyTTibeBZxpHX_OQ10LXq7RNE5yXNRwiABAdrpdlPhg0SsqTFcARM30YG6zBz4dnVEXHD_PBHD73Tj_sujbXqW)\n[2] google.com (https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQG9iZ0Ov0Jr-4BYxpsTrDMXINcaJz0sqyMOjwRXQZcrbDEm4Qhqpmstl7uPRTvXbfOeb6pjejfOmmNbwUYsgcuwWshD9deZ5tEYoaGyKCbRV8sXJzWYj3zLDmXN33BjYUg=)\n[3] google.com (https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGmoq5u1bI5g3hmOhUapftUEJxALbEhWNGDzi1W6ZpH1MbxqhL3QkEK7sKMWEwfdDdK184dlKbwnR-MroOMFZWhp_xP2d64Nii-tiLBC-rzBp2umUH88ERPMgFW7U1dloEYsTbMeIRQeBwh5iCl8MtQN15E)\n[4] google.com (https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQF9E5huaQrgiNbQIWpMNI0Gjr6tO4KDIk_SIiHQuXBoDAZ-XVLVC6BXjhAXfUB23Ud6RRAyEfdsNI_sS_L6yrz8kfgjVONNX2B5AxMHCySMC51DTjSZDHsvtrjGpEuc1R2ypUlL_sXpBb_e)\n[5] google.com (https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEm6wp1r10V4XjRIAU1OG86LTi6W9IrDkUuozokX-X0g0cwBIFZVZjdJLQ6eeL7jxo-gJHBIuQGTrgQYN4KsaaurSEXc4_znL1X0i9ev-b-HwU8fSlZg6ZxxCmtFgCptEiBmT_VAuRwHIfj3XV1z3hQMa2mHmh-Q-tQoWANqw==)\n[6] google.com (https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFDxfKHvWZMJVrPabU-ElAhZziDC7krAN8sezN56_t3m2RH_0V9C24AMbCzu1hcfqZdXhRSWUN9ZpRQbqkj6wyQa9Tnh_8UjLdFYZlkHVT_2ZpbMC79wJS7btaYszZnDcy6yf0pLcCrYU0MlDlzaJYYseP_Rlk0pQuX2fEpaIDJ)\n[7] google.com (https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGoUhDdxXQs91iuOz79MdfW34bSIAiS_D6LE2sZriEmWKpupx4byz6jkPyzwLydPiNO3MblR8z4Vswci80mhjHX6fL3p3ZzuAnX0l7M2JV8hUpn3AkTw4sxNfV6C13rdS6fnK54OsyeN5JaLzvzUmMdcedSsF2xALJygg_1FfzvkIZjZd7O6bZbingoTc0G9gz0)\n[8] dzone.com (https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQElIoQi-KkcnAIe7vy3RGpidDEipkemB7faSYZAgsrVe5-daaTgJsUrU06PfK0muDyw1lqG_GKzvYhcFoVrLL_Hw6bcIOBzrLqRCAKwXuFJZt6kQgGZSgMKX9tVgIo-1JxjNE_-KhAtjN1EuOlQ7a4=)\n[9] youtube.com (https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFRHJHotFI3nBiHzCa-VS-zpx9XQeu7WAYkM9GWNKAjyzl4A7VfNzB8v0e-BBBZYDqn1eRSDdDEVNn1YJcRzPUzIxtV9qoW-H9h5TXvU-FPqhQgIzgTu1nAnQJ8GU9ffO8Pxuapoqw=)\n[10] google.com (https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHMIAd2Q7AsUk_WiJgdASG1naGIHsiNwbimjz3EM4_7YIL2yzyNq6EjCVOyy_jD5TzG8NNQDtgvmqqGNCrmov55t7PkZPsHvBNktxqe1OPdhzR2sek8tzFLYZk1EyOn7qGlfhP3xfMzwF2eNFgw27HuiQA_P2Wim34s)\n[11] google.com (https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHPHsxWpTDNCTcIyv29lpt9vd-6MgEAED5T7cdAollBRpA7WZssAZWogJ7HkgYl9X7xDjMkNL32D2jgydyrgWbKuZjb3zmtsitdqtSZKbkmQmUMSpWnMgx0rBGA4xqH-vk6Otr_ycgThedRhAEt5QNyNV5z4AdLQg==)\n[12] youtube.com (https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFNA5FBGmMbyZgENP3b-qQHabe_n_pxSaGTxxj7dcb4oXiTJ3I1zOUW2YLyEd79SfUpFOFwdS14KO7UoXl66qyEpXcIQUoWHuCVEG-N2mqLFEQ7DR0HkG2C81viYBovV09T1xe-kEY=)\n[13] medium.com (https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQF911sdRsUNCDXMsnPh_knVrMS47gf_ZyEPhda3wCOdrZeGbtlkKLN3utj8PyiiRclrEC-aI-3_MCb2aygRcko1g4mK_Ngz2_8LV5VuIlh18MNh9O6uHLfRny-2lIHWhxwcz0R_h_abnsQoEUaD9SilecmeYc2mIP88ouhuxRjwpsqjYTzq2H0CYNklpoFOog==)\n[14] google.com (https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEkZ3EW30jyjJEWMy0Ctmwfo7d3BCcLbAYvkNdmjo5U5dybXfdtlFL2tdvQInQKerOzNofZDygh2PnZNCMmhMgIoXLE4YxVjJeg5ws6HAyqnTIQgFY7eUFqiNIjJwAKn4aXPlTvlZeX8miOJv1zm4qAPYylHf_d)\n[15] medium.com (https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHfmem-XbQRO7GvOH2cg_ChVf8QWsV_x79cIJn2m2UzCY1axssW8cw0v6J5W1jWumpNTXyqJ5qwmSUqhdg4DudSpPUVtid-UDT3_Wn2i5K2x00W5ccA6lZCvX7EKUf87_tZ0wX1v3vW7yKrtcPDnaXha4DUOFwv-EczEDApMf6uOpZpKrYjDCJ4vMbn9uP0NrJnJdRO7VU1dPoRmmDY7G_FR5v2UCRPIejCU3s=)"
